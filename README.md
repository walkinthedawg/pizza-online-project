# Online Pizza Project #4
Welcome to the Walkin the Dawg Band site!
We are a Classic Rock and Roll Band based in the Sacramento CA area.
This site is for the use of promotion of the band.
It showcases some sample videos and mp3's of our performances.
It has a calendar page showing our upcoming shows.
There is a bio page to get acquanted with each member of the band.
You can also download our online press kit for more info about booking the band.
And a Contact page to email, text or give our booking agent a call.

# UX
This website is for anyone looking to hire a live rock and roll band in the Sacramento CA area.
Anyone looking for a band has specific things they want to look for.
This site starts with the Main Page.
It is an overall look of the band in a live situation.
It introduces the visitor to the menu and feel of the site.
The other pages provide audio and video samples for the visitor to experience.
We also have a calendar showing past and upcoming events.
A bio page introduces each member of the band.
And a contact page that provides all the info needed to connect to the band leader.

As an example of the usefullness of the site....we had a person from a Boomers Club 
express interest in the band.  We provided him with our website and he immediately loved what he saw.
Contacting us, we set a couple future venues to host the Boomers Group!

Another person saw us play at Denios Farmers Market and was looking for a New Years Eve band.
Once again, they loved the website and hired us to play for their event.

This website is a continuing evolvement.  This is the 5th version of several previous websites.
This one is clean, simple and to the point.

# FEATURES
1) Index or Main Page.  Simple, clean introduction of the band in visual form and written
explanation of what we like to play and offer our customers.

2) Videos Page.  We offer many Youtube videos of the band in live situations.

3) Audio Page.  Five samples of mp3 recordings of live venues we have played at.

4) Shows Page.  A dynamic calendar showing previous and future events for the band.

5) Bios Page. Featuring photos and biographies of each member of the band.

6) Contact Page. Clearly shows how to contact the leader of the band for booking appts.

*Additional Pages in planning stage:*   
-Song List Page.  List of most of our current song list.
Maybe a three column list of 60 songs and artists listed.
-Also thinking about adding a Trivia Page.  Such as....who was the first one off the plane
when the Beatles landed in New York?   George!

# TECHNOLOGIES USED
This is a simple website consisting of mainly HTML in a BootStrap Framework.
CSS is used to control and decorate everything.

# TESTING
Since this is a static website, no DB is used.  Nothing is stored in a DB or in the Cloud.
There is no forms to fill out either.  Testing was done completely manually.
All links were checked.  All Social Media Buttons were tested.  Menu items were checked.
The website is fully responsive since we used Bootstrap as the Framework.
The website was tested at all screen sizes both by adjusting browser width and on actual devices.
I have an ancient iTouch, two iPhones, 3 iPads, an Android Tablet, two laptops and a three monitor desktop.
The site performed well with all devices.

# DEPLOYMENT
The site was built on Cloud 9 as part of class.
I deployed the site to BlueHost.
I purchased the domain name and hosted it on their 3 yr Plus Plan.
It was easy to deploy since no DB was involved.  Simply use FTP to upload all files
to the server.  No config files.  Nothing.
